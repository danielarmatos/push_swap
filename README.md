# Push Swap


The Push Swap project is part of the curriculum at 42 school and is designed to challenge students to develop their problem-solving abilities, algorithmic thinking, and understanding of data structures.

&nbsp;
### Project Objective
The primary objective of the Push Swap project is to sort a given list of integers with a set of predefined operations while using minimal moves. This project not only tests your ability to implement sorting algorithms but also encourages you to optimize them for efficiency. This project is written in C language.

&nbsp;

### Rules and Constraints
Here are the key rules and constraints of the Push Swap project:
&nbsp;
* **Input:** You are provided with two stacks, A and B. Stack A contains a random list of integers, and stack B is initially empty.
&nbsp;

* **Operations:** You can perform a set of predefined operations on these stacks:
    * sa: Swap the first two elements of stack A.
    * sb: Swap the first two elements of stack B.
    * ss: Perform sa and sb simultaneously.
    * pa: Push the first element of stack A onto stack B.
    * pb: Push the first element of stack B onto stack A.
    * ra: Rotate stack A (move the first element to the end).
    * rb: Rotate stack B.
    * rr: Rotate both stacks A and B.
    * rra: Reverse rotate stack A (move the last element to the beginning).
    * rrb: Reverse rotate stack B.
    * rrr: Reverse rotate both stacks A and B.
&nbsp;

* **Sorting Objective:** Your goal is to sort the integers in stack A in ascending order. Stack B can be used as a temporary buffer to achieve this.
&nbsp;

* **Winning Criteria:** The project is considered successful if you can sort the list using the minimum number of operations.â€¨
